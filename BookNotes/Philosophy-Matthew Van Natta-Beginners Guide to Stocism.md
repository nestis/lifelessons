 Stoicism teaches you to focus on your thoughts and actions on what you can control.
Dichotomy of Control. Some things are in your control, some are outside your control. Something is either 100% in your control, or is an indifferent.
In every situation, remind yourself that you own your value judgements and decisions.

## Indifferents
There are things in life that are neither good nor bad themselves, yet their usage can make good or bad. Everything that is external and not in oneâ€™s control should be considered an indifferent.
Categorizing everything outside your control as indifferent says you recognize that such things cant provide lasting happiness.

Those that benefit us are _Preferred Indifferents_. Those that are detrimental are called _Dispreferred Indifferents_.
-  **Preferred Indifferents**: According to Nature. Life, health, pleasure, beatuy, strength...
-  **Dispreferred Indifferents**: Death, disease, pain, ugliness, weakness...

_Negative passions_ are based on mistaken judgements. Out of harmony of life. To obtain virtue we excise from them.

#### Good Passions

## Negative visualizations
You should rehearse the big challenges of life as they are inevitable. The idea is to visualize worst-case scenarios.
_What is in your control? What should you desire and avoid? Do you accept the value judgements that bubble up?_
*How should you act? Can you remain in harmony? Can you even find joy?*
