**Problem solving** is a process that can be broken down into four steps:
1. Understand current situation
2. Identify the root cause of the problem
3. Develop an effective action plan
4. Execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as neccesary

Remember the difference between the symptom (headache), the root cause (fever) and the prescription (medicine).
The better you get at understanding the symptoms and indentifying the root cause, the better you get at developing effective solutions.

#### Problem Solving Tools
##### Logic Tree
Great tool to identify all the potential root causes of a problem and generate a variety of solutions.
The key is to break down a problem into categories with leaving anything out, and to group similar items under the same branch.
To make the tree grow vertically repeteadly ask yourself _"Are there other ways of solving the problem?"_
To grow horizontally, ask yourself _"Specifically, how or what falls into this category?"_

i.e. How can I increase amount of pepper that comes out of the bottle in one shake?
1. Increase the area of the top surface
2. Increase the amount of the pepper that comes out of the surface are
   1. Increase number of holes
   2. Increase the amount of pepper that comes out of each hole
      1. Increase the size of the holes
      2. Reduce size of pepper grains.

A Logic tree can also be transformed into a Yes/No tree.

##### Yes/No Tree
Groups items into buckets based on the answers to yes/no questions, assigning every item a bucket.
Write down a question. Consider whether a yes or no answer will lead to an explanation (bucket) or to another question. Repeat until you've created buckets for all the possible explanations.3

Did the alarm ring this morning?
1. **Yes** Explanation: It rang but I couldnt wake up/I heard it but turned it off.
2. **No** _Is the clock ticking?_
   1. **Yes** _Was the alarm for 6am?_
      1. **No** Explanation: I didnae set the alarm correctly.
      2. **Yes** _Is the alarm enabled?_
         1. **No** Explanation: I forgot to enable the alarm.
         2. **Yes** _Does the alarm ring?_
            1. **Yes** Explanation: It rang but I did not heard it
            2. **No**  Explanation: Alarm is broken.
    2. **No** _Is battery in place properly?_
       1. **No** Explanation: Battery was not in place properly.
       2. **Yes** _Is the battery charged?_
          1. **Yes** Explanation: Alarm is broken.
          2. **No** Battery was dead.      

#### Design Plan
You should develop a problem solving design before you start chasing after information. In the design plan you clarify the issues you're trying to solve, state your current hypotheses and rationale, and list analysis, actions and information required to prove or disprove those hypotheses.
| Issue | Hypothesis | Rationale | Analysis/Activities | Information source |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
Alarm not working | Battery is dead | Alarm didnt ring this morning | Change the battery

Example. Break down big problems in smaller goals
1. Set a clear goal.

2. Determine the gap between the goal and the current situation.

3. Form an hypothesis about how to close the gap and achieve the goal. List as many options and ideas to close the gap, using a Logic Tree. Select the best ideas as your hypothesis. Cut tree branches if they are not effective or feasible, and highlight the best ideas on the tree.
**Problem Solving Tool -> _Hypothesis pyramid_**
Great too for structuring an argument. Using it to clarify your conclusion and rationale before driving into data collection and analysis will improve your productivity. Two types, _grouping structure_ and _argument structure_.
3.1 Grouping structure, main idea is supported by different and coherent ideas. Main ideas remains even if one supporting idea is false.
_School is fun <-- School Sports are fun/Lunch time is fun/Classes are fun_
3.2 _Argument structure, multiple statements lead to a conclusion._ All arguments must be true.
_Salmon are fish -> Fish are good swimmers ----> Salmon are good swimmers!_

4. Check the hypotheses. Go back to _3_ if disproved.
Design a plan that contains all hypotheses and the information requried to test them (Design Plan table)

### Helpful tools when you need to evaluate mutiple options
##### Pros and Cons
Helpful when you need to evaluate multiple options and select the best one.
List all the options, list all the pros and cons. Even if you think one option is the best one, get into the habit of asking "Arent there negative aspects? Are there other positive aspects?"
Weight every option with positive and negative points.

##### Criteria and Evaluation
To clarify which criteria or qualifications you should use to evaluate your options, decide the importance set of criteria and effectively evaluate your options.
List all the options.
List the evaluation criteria and decide the importance of each one.
Evaluate each option based on the Weighted Criteria.

##### Challenge your decisions
**Spend more time thinking about actions you can take to get closer to your goals. Spend less time worrying about things.**
- Challenge your own thinking processes. 
  _What are the pros and cons? Do I have the full list? Which option looks more attractive?_
  _What are the specific criteria I should be using?_
  _Is my evaluation correct?_
