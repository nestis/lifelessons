**Much of what we know about motivation is wrong.**

Tasks are either: 
- Algorithmic—you pretty much do the same thing over and over in a certain way
- Heuristic—you have to come up with something new every time because there are no set instructions to follow.
**The carrot and stick approach to motivation is flawed.**

**Extrinsic rewards can be effective for algorithmic tasks—those that depend on following an existing formula to its logical conclusion**.
For **those that demand flexible problem-solving, inventiveness, or conceptual understanding—contingent rewards can be dangerous.**

**“if-then” motivators are terrible for challenges** Rewards narrow people’s focus and blinkered the wide view that might have allowed them to see new uses for old objects.

**Goals that people set for themselves and that are devoted to attaining mastery are usually healthy. But goals imposed by others can sometimes have dangerous side effects.**
We have three innate psychological needs—competence, autonomy, and relatedness.
Research shows that the secret to high performance isn’t our biological drive or our reward-and-punishment drive, but our third drive—our deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilities, and to live a life of purpose.

The new approach to motivation has three essential elements:
- **Autonomy**—the desire to direct our own lives;
- **Mastery**—the urge to get better and better at something that matters;
- **Purpose**—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.

The science shows that the **secret to high performance isn’t our biological drive or our reward-and-punishment drive, but our third drive—our deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilities, and to live a life of purpose**

##### Sentences

> “When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity.”

> “When children didn’t expect a reward, receiving one had little impact on their intrinsic motivation. Only contingent rewards—if you do this, then you’ll get that—had the negative effect. Why? ‘If-then’ rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy.”

> “People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person’s motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person’s intrinsic motivation toward the activity.”—Jonmarshall Reeve
