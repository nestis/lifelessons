**It is the identity of the of the team that matters — not so much what the All Blacks do, but who they are, what they stand for, and why they exist.**

**A collection of talented individuals without personal discipline will ultimately and inevitably fail.**

**Leave the jersey in a better place**

##### Character
Humility and discipline. **Never be too big to do the things that need to be done**
Failures are the biggest opportunity to learn. Performance = Capability + Behavior.
##### Adapt
**When you are on top of your game, change your game**. Culture is subject to learning, growth, and decline.
##### Purpose
**Ask why?** Leaders connect personal meaning to a higher purpose. Humans seek personal purpose. People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.
##### Responsability
Pass the ball, **leaders create leaders.** Empower the individual by empowering them with the success of the team.
##### Learn
Leaders are teachers. **Improving 100 things by 1%. By finding the 100 things that can be done just 1% better, you achieve marginal gain which creates an incremental and cumulative advantage in performance and results.**
##### Whanau
**No dickheads**. Everyone works together towards the same goal, no one left behind. **The strength of the wolf is the pack, the strength of the pack is the wolf.**
##### Expectations
Aim for the highest cloud. **Successful leaders have high internal benchmarks, they set their expectations high**, and try to exceed them.
##### Preparation
Train to win, practice under pressure. **Practice with intensity to develop the mindset to win**. Get out of your comfort zone. If you are not growing anywhere, you are not going anywhere.
##### Pressure
**Keep a blue head.** The first stage of learning is silence; the second stage is listening. Know how to manage, deal and embrace pressure. Switch from ‘Red head’ — tight-inhibited, result-oriented, anxious, aggressive, overcompensating, desperate; to ‘blue head’ — loose, expressive, at the moment, calm, clear, accurate, untasked.
##### Authencity
**Know thyself and keep it real.** Leaders need to create an environment that encourages safe-conflict, honesty, and integrity
##### Sacrifice
**Champions do extra** *“There are no crowns waiting in the extra mile, on the extra mile we are on our own, just us and the challenge we’ve set ourselves.”*
##### Language
Let your ears listen. Invent a language — sing your world into existence. A system of meaning that everyone understood. ** A language, vocabulary and a set of believes that bind the group together**
##### Ritual
**Create a culture**. Inspiring leaders establish rituals to connect their team to its core narrative, using them to reflect, remind, reinforce and reignite their collective identity and purpose.
##### Whakapapa
**Plant trees you´ll never see**. True leaders take responsibility adding to the future. Ensure knowledge transfer.
##### Legacy
**It is your time. Be purposeful.**
