Competence + Warmth = Charisma
When you need credibility and be taken seriously, competence cues.
When you need collaboration and trust, warmth cues.
Written cues work as much as oral cues.
Men are seen higher in competence by default. They need to work on warmth cues, verbal and non-verbal.
Try to verbally mimick the first seconds of an interaction.
- Its good to see you! - It's good to see you too.

Labeling negative cues, reduces their impact.
Warmth cues, triggers others' warmth.
Most people make the mistake of not looking too excited when negotiating for something they want.
Showing nonverbal signs of disgreement when you hear a bad offer, can cause the person to make langer concessions.

## Charima Cues
### Leaning. Fastest single way to look (and feel) interested and engaged.
When: You want to show support and interest. Call attention to somebody's ideas and show you agree. When giving a presentation, to emphasize your most important points.

### Anti-Blocking. An open body signals an open mind. Keep your body free of any blocks.
When: 1:1 interactiones when you need to create rapport. You need to spark ideas. You're presenting or pitching.
When not: Openness is not the message you want to deliver. You dont want to engage.

When: Signal respect and/or care.

### Space. Observe all your four space zones.
You can decode how someone feels about you based on how close they stand or sit.

Wowing someone is meeting him at the point of energy and attitude where they are. Helps emotionally sync up and enables empathy.

Liars accidentally drop their volume because they' re nervous. Best communicators speak louder and vary their volume.
Emotion usually enhaces the message.

Non word invitations. Mmmmhhh, Uh-huh...
Encouraging words: Yes, Wow, Greet, Keep going, Fascinating, Really?

Relax your shoulders. Plase your feet 3 inches wider than you normally would. Relax your hands.

### Explanatory gestures. Use clear hand gestures to demonstrate points.
Confident people dont waste energy on purposeless movements. They move with intention. They also lower cognitive load of the speaker and the listener.
Examples:
- When presenting numbers, empathize them by showing them on your hand.
- Use your fingers to show if something is big or small.
- Point to yourself, touch your heart if talking abuot something personal or own opinion.
- Them vs Us. Express two different options, opinions...on different hands.
- This is going to be good! when starting a presentation. Taking off some glasses, roll up your sleeves...
When not: When you dont want people lok at you (you want them to focus on slides or something else). People look at your hand and not to you, you're excedding.

### Palm Flash. Attract attention. An open palm is an invitation.
The bigger the room, the bigger you can gesture.

### Volume dynamism. Use volume to support your points. 

### Power pause. Pause to create intrigue right before an important point.
Every time you feel you want ot use a filler, simply take a breath.
Shorter is better. Dont mistake power pause, with end pause. Pausing at the end of a sentence, is an end pause. It does not have the effect.

Highly competent people love to get confirmation on how competent they are. Tell your friends:
- You're so interesting. You always give the best advice. I knew you would know what to do.

## Danger Zones
### Lip Purse. Pressed lips show withholding or closing up.

### Distancing. When we dont like something, or we want someone to move away or lean back to create distance.
What to do: Research. What was the cause? Clarify, clear up confusion. Find something you both can lean in to.

### Body Cues
Ventilating. When we get nervous we try to get air on our skin to cool ourselves off or to give ourselves space.
Comfort Gesture. We self-touch to calm ourselves down or to comfort ourselves.
Preen. When we adjust our hair, make-up, clothing... Signals nervousness.
Suprasternal notch touch. When we're nervous or want to self confort.
Body block. When we want to protect ourselves or self-comfort, we put a barrier in front of our body.
Shame. Face palm. When we feel ashamed we might touch the sides of our forehead with our fingertips.
Anger. When we feel angry, we pull our eyebrows down into a furrow. Harden our lower lids and tense our lips.
Nose Flare. We might flare our nostrils in anger.
Sadness. We pull the corners of our eyebrows down, and together move our lips to frown.
Mouth Shrug. Signals disbelief or doubt.
Contempt. We pull up one side of our mouth into a smirk.

### Question inflection. When we're asking questions, we go up in vocal pitch at the end. Dont accidentally use it on a statement.
When using question inflection, we invite people to doubt your competence.

### Vocal Fry. When we lose breath our vocal cords rattle together to produce a grating vocal fry.
If hear yourself on Vocal fry, take a breath, and speak a tiny bit louder.
Speaking up eliminates it.

### Verbal Fillers. Fluff words like um, so, like...signal a lack of confidence or knowledge.
They enable you to speak faster, but not neccesarily better.
If you use them for transitions, work on alternative phrases or stories.
If it is out of habit, try to breath instead.

### Vocal Denials. When we dont like something we make negative listening sounds like Yikes, ugh... these signal disagreement.
Oooff, Eeck, Ay-ay-ay, Yikes...

### Danger words
Hi. Been busy? It's been crazy. Let's wait for everyone to join. What's up?
Nothing, Talk soon. Bye. See you soon.
How are u? Whats going on?

## Before your next presentation...
Take some deep belly breaths. Dont breathe with your shoulders.
Do quick posture fixes. Shoulders down, widen your feet, roll hands out...
Try a vocal exercise. sing/hum your favourite song to yourself.
If some minutes, watch speaker videos on your phone.
