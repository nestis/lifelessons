# Coaching for Performance

**The Inner Game improves performance by seeking to remove inner obstacles to outer performance.**
**Coaching is unlocking people´s potential to maximize their own performance.**

Good coaching, and good mentoring for that matter, can and should take a performer beyond the limitations of the coach or mentor´s own knowledge.
Unless the coach believes hat people possess more capability than they are currently expressing, he will not be able to help them express it. **He must think of his people in terms of their potential, not their performance.**
Asking ourselves, What external and internal blocks obstruc the manifestation of the rest of that potential??
**Greatest internal barrier, inability to give up** telling what you have done before, old habits.. 
If introduced sensitively, coaching is welcomed. Any change of behavour comes with resistance.

**Tackle one fear at a time.** Skiier example. The resort is far below and he´s afraid. Point to a place in 100 meters. Then to next one in another 100 meters. Repeat.

**Building AWARENESS and RESPONSABILITY is the essence of good coaching.** 
**Awareness** is something that develops quickly through simple practice and application.
- Awareness is knowing what´s happening around you
- Self-awareness is knowing what you´re experiencing

**Responsability**, crucial for high performance, is when we truly accept, choose, or take responsability for our thoughts and our actions. Difference between normal or imposed responsability
- *Fred go a get a ladder* => *There´s no ladder there.*
- *We need a ladder from the shed. Who can get it?* => *I will*
If there is no ladder, he will look elsewhere because he wants to succeed. It´s the coachee´s choice.


Effective questions to create awareness
- *Which way is the ball spinning as it comes towards you?*
- *How high is it this time as it crosses the net?*

These questions make the coachee to focus on the ball as opose to "Are you watching the ball?"
**Is better to tell the coachee that coach has a suggestion rather than attempt to manipulate him in one direction.** Questions that imply criticism should also be avoided.

Other useful questions
- *What else?*
- *If you knew the answer what would it be?*
- *What would the consequences of that be for you or for others?*
- *What criteria are you using?*
- *What´s the most challenging part of this for you?*
- *What advice would you give a friend in your situation?*
- *What would you gain/lose by doing/saying this?*

**Questions can be intimidating, hence coach must not be judgamental. There no "right" answers, just honest ones.**

Four stages of development. Person needs to recognize a certain attitude or behaviour is happening. It may takes some time. Accept this conditioned response. Person become willng to let go the attitude. Person consciously letting go, with action planning

**Our behaviour is 80% reaction, 20% choice.**
- Where does the impulse come from for this action?
- Is this true or is it an assumption or a belief?

##### GROW
- **Goal** setting for the session. 
- **Reality** checking the current situation
- **Options** and strategies or courses of action.
- **What** is to be done? **When**? by **Whom**? and the **Will** to do it.

**Goals** are set before the reality because otherwise they are a response to a problem, limited by past performance. Althought they are subject to recycle. One might define a vague goal until one has examined the reality. Also, a sharply defined initial goal may be recognized to be wrong.
**An end goal should whenever possible be supported by a performance goal. End goal provide inspiration, performance goal defines the specification.**

**Reality**
We control over what we are aware of, but what we are unaware of controls us.
**Imperative to follow the coachee´s train of thought rather than asserting coach´s own.** If the coachee raises a problem and feel threatened, his description will be distorted to make things look batter than they are.

Most thoughts carry an emotion with them, are reflected in the body as it often triggers thoughts. Concerns, blockages and inhibitions can be approached through the mind, the body or the emotions.
Reality questions should be initiated with *what, when, where, who* and *how much*. They seek facts. must have answers that
- Compel the coachee to think
- Demand high-resolution focus to obtain high-quality input.
- Descriptive and not judgamental.
- Has sufficient wuality and frequency to provide the coach with a feedback loop.

Improvement takes place through the application of awareness during the reality phase.

**Options**
Is not to find the "right" answer but to create and list as many alternative courses of action as possible. Quantity is more importante than quality and/or feasibility at this stage.
Even silly contributions need to be noted down since they may be the germ of an great idea.
A good coach would invite his coachee to ask themselves "What if....?"
- What if you had a larger budget?
- What if you had more staff?
- What if this obstacle didnt exist?

After list of options has been created, the will phase may be just a matter of selecting the best of the list. In complex issues, may be worthy noting the benefits and the costs of each course of action.
**Coache should offer his expertise when he recognizes the coachee has exhausted his possibilities, simply by saying "I have another option, Would you like to hear it?"
Any coach suggestion should be as important as the others. No more, no less.**

**Will**
Coach can bring some thoughness to this phase without causing any bad feelings, he´s not imposing his own but activating the will of the coachee.
**What are you going to do?** Firm decision, clear, firm voice.
**When are you going to do it?** Needs to be specific, only with a time frame it takes a level of reality.
**Will this action meet your goal?** Check if the action is leading in the goal direction. If it´s offtrack, no rush to change the action, but check if the goal needs to be changed.
**What obstacles you´ll find along the way?** To prepare and pre-empt any circunstances that could arise.
**Who needs to know? What support do you need? What other considerations do you have?**
**Rate on a 1-10 scale, the degree of certainty you have that you´ll carry the actions agreed.**
**What prevents it from being a 10?** Less than 8, reduce the action size or lengthen the time. If still below 8, cross out the action.

#### Practice
Four stages of learning
- Unconscious incompetence
- Conscious imcompetence
- Unconscious competence
- Conscious competence

Huge difference between continously trying to do something right and continously monitoring what we are doing nonjudgementally. The latter, the input-feedback loop, that results in quality learning and improvement. 

**Real enjoyment comes from experiencing something as it is happening, not thinking about a past experience or a future event.** Many people spoil their enjoyment by being in the past (what they just failed to do) or the future (fearing what might occur). Performance suffers and quality awareness and feedback from their own body is greatly reduced.
Asking ourselves what we feel, touch, hear, see, smell, taste...focusing to find the answers heightnes our awareness and enjoyment.

**Meaning is mainly philosophical whiile purpose is a spiritual concept!**

#### Feedback
Defensiveness must be avoided. The truth becomes smothered in inaccurate excuses.
Detailed description of the problem. *The ball was out* rather than *You blew that one*.
Feedback relates to the past. **It is the anticipation of the question that causes you to be aware in the present. *"On the next ball I´m gonna ask what´s the part you feel less confortable".***

We look feedback from our pov rather than the performer. Primary objective must be to understand what the performer needs in order to perform the task well.
> It is very important for a tennis player to watch the ball. If you ask him to do it, he won´t. If you ask him the number of times the ball revolves, totally unimportant, he will watch the ball.
It´s about tackling the cause, not the sympton (not watching the ball).

#### Team Development
First stage is inclusion, people determine if they are or feel part of the group. Team members may not be very performant on this phase, their focus will be emotional needs and concerns.
Team leader will be looked for acceptance and guidance. **Tone and example set by the leader is very important, it becomes the accepted norm.**
Good leader will attempt to address and satify individual concerns so group can move forward.

Second, individual assertion. Establishment of roles and functions. Competition within the team is hot, may lead to exceptional performance sometimes at the expense of others. No cohesivenes. **Team members need to find out they disagree with the elader before they agree.**
Good leader will offer members to take responsabilities and allow the challenges. Balancing act.
Not so many teams advance beyond this stage.

Cooperation. Dangerous, team becomes too comfortable to allow any dissent. **Good to have a certain degree of dynamic tension.**
**How?**
- **Discuss and agree definition of a ser of common goals for the team.** Always room for modification. Each member should be invited to contribute. Personal goals might be embraced within the overall team goals.
- **Develop a set of ground rules acceptable to all team member, which to all have contributed.** Regularly checked whether tthey are being adhered or need to be changed.
- Canvas members views about the desired structured social time together.
- Set aside time on a regualr basis for group process work. Rules are reviewed. No talk about task.
- Develop a common interest outside work.
- Learn a new skill together
